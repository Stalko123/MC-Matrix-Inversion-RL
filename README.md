# Monte Carlo Matrix Inversion and Reinforcement Learning – Reproduction & Experiments

This repository reproduces and extends the results from **Barto & Duff (1993)** on Monte Carlo Matrix Inversion (MCMI) for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. The focus is on implementing the algorithm, reproducing the original experiments, and performing extended analyses to explore performance under various conditions.
